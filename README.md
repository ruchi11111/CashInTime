The project entitled “Cash In-Time” is a useful in the time of emergency. Money is a verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context. This shows how important money is in our day to day life. Cash is required for many various activities.

There are many shops which doesn‟t have facility of card payment or any related facility. This can be a problem for those who do not have cash. At that point of time we have to find ATMs near us which are not always available. At times situation may arise that after waiting in the long queues the denominations are not available in the ATMs. This in turn leads to waste of time and also gets much tedious and irritating. Also banks are closed on national holidays or have strikes at time, so getting cash from bank is also not a regular
option.

To solve problems like this the application Cash In-Time will help the people in need of cash where we won‟t be going here and there in search of ATMs and also ready cash
would be available.

I have uploaded a report of the project for an in-depth insight and a presentation for a rough idea.
